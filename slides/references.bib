  abstract      = {Modern Bayesian approaches and workflows emphasize in how simulation is important in the context of model developing. Simulation can help researchers understand how the model behaves in a controlled setting and can be used to stress the model in different ways before it is exposed to any real data. This improved understanding could be beneficial in epidemiological models, specially when dealing with COVID-19. Unfortunately, few researchers perform any simulations. We present a simulation algorithm that implements a simple agent-based model for disease transmission that works with a standard compartment epidemiological model for COVID-19. Our algorithm can be applied in different parameterizations to reflect several plausible epidemic scenarios. Additionally, we also model how social media information in the form of daily symptom mentions can be incorporate into COVID-19 epidemiological models. We test our social media COVID-19 model with two experiments. The first using simulated data from our agent-based simulation algorithm and the second with real data using a machine learning tweet classifier to identify tweets that mention symptoms from noise. Our results shows how a COVID-19 model can be (1) used to incorporate social media data and (2) assessed and evaluated with simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.},

  abstract     = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate both data and prior knowledge into the model estimates. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent. Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, then with a more elaborate transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced topics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational techniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.},

JuliaSim can build accelerated surrogates from component-based models, such as those conforming to the FMI standard, using continuous-time echo state networks (CTESN). The foundation of this environment, ModelingToolkit.jl, is an acausal modeling language which can compose the trained surrogates as components within its staged compilation process. As a complementary factor we present the JuliaSim model library, a standard library with differential-algebraic equations and pre-trained surrogates, which can be composed using the modeling system for design, optimization, and control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the surrogate-accelerated modeling and simulation approach on HVAC dynamics by showing that the CTESN surrogates accurately capture the dynamics of a HVAC cycle at less than 4\textbackslash\% error while accelerating its simulation by 340x. We illustrate the use of surrogate acceleration in the design process via global optimization of simulation parameters using the embedded surrogate, yielding a speedup of two orders of magnitude to find the optimum. We showcase the surrogate deployed in a co-simulation loop, as a drop-in replacement for one of the coupled FMUs, allowing engineers to effectively explore the design space of a coupled system. Together this demonstrates a workflow for automating the integration of machine learning techniques into traditional modeling and simulation processes.},

  abstract      = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations, can all be transformed into UDE training problems that are efficiently solved by a single software methodology.},

  abstract     = {This is the first of two papers that use off-training set (OTS) error to investigate the assumption-free relationship between learning algorithms. This first paper discusses the senses in which there are no a priori distinctions between learning algorithms. (The second paper discusses the senses in which there are such distinctions.) In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are "as many" targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected OTS error than B as vice versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is "anti-cross-validation" (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one cannot say: if empirical misclassification rate is low, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of your generalizer is small, and the training set is large, then with high probability your OTS error is small. Other implications for "membership queries" algorithms and "punting" algorithms are also discussed. "Even after the observation of the frequent conjunction of objects, we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have had experience."

In this manuscript we detail the inner workings of NeuralPDE.jl and show how a formulation structured around numerical quadrature gives rise to new loss functions which allow for adaptivity towards bounded error tolerances. We describe the various ways one can use the tool, detailing mathematical techniques like using extended loss functions for parameter estimation and operator discovery, to help potential users adopt these PINN-based techniques into their workflow. We showcase how NeuralPDE uses a purely symbolic formulation so that all of the underlying training code is generated from an abstract formulation, and show how to make use of GPUs and solve systems of PDEs. Afterwards we give a detailed performance analysis which showcases the trade-off between training techniques on a large set of PDEs. We end by focusing on a complex multiphysics example, the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) Model, and showcase how this PDE can be formulated and solved with NeuralPDE. Together this manuscript is meant to be a detailed and approachable technical report to help potential users of the technique quickly get a sense of the real-world performance trade-offs and use cases of the PINN techniques.},

  abstract     = {Background and objective an accurate estimation of the epidemiological model coefficients helps understand the basic principles of disease spreading. Some studies showed that dozens of hours are needed to simulate the traditional probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) model, and dozens of hours are spent for a fine-tuning of the system. Here, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate model to mimic a PCA model to reduce the simulations' computational time, maintaining an equivalent precision in the estimates. Method we consider PCA models based on regular lattices of different sizes to generate training data sets varying the parameters related to individuals' movement in the lattice and the disease infectivity. These parameters are the input variables for training the surrogate model, and the outputs parameters to be fitted are the percentages of susceptible and infected individuals at the steady-state, the basic reproduction number R0, the peak value and the peak instant of infected individuals, I(τ) and τ, respectively. Results The proposed surrogate model can predict all the output variables with a low relative error. The surrogate model's training time is independent of the size of the lattice, and the time for evaluating a solution by the surrogate model is low and independent of the lattice size. Conclusions The surrogate model provides a fast simulation time for a generic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model in a PCA, which is helpful for tuning the model before final simulations, supporting the initial search for inverse problems of parameters estimation in SIR models and providing a satisfactory estimation of the output variables for large populations.},

  abstract      = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

The model assumes a time-varying effective contact rate (equivalently, a time-varying reproduction number) to model the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A crucial technical challenge in applying such models is their accurate calibration to observed data, e.g., to the daily number of confirmed new cases, as the past history of the disease strongly affects predictions of future scenarios. We demonstrate an approach based on inversion of the SEIR equations in conjunction with statistical modelling and spline-fitting of the data, to produce a robust methodology for calibration of a wide class of models of this type.},

  abstract     = {Compartmental epidemic models have been used extensively to study the historical spread of infectious diseases and to inform strategies for future control. A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user’s estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals—considered to be a major limitation of similar methods—can be eliminated by an efficient, “peak-to-peak” iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.},
